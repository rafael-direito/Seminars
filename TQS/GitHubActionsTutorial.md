# GitHub Actions Demonstration

For this demonstration we will deploy a [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) instance using GitHub Actions.

# 1. Create the GitHub Repository

First of all, you'll have to create a GitHub Repository to host your code. Then, clone this repository to your local VM.

# 2. Install Docusaurus

## 2.1 What is docusauros?

Docusaurus is a **static-site generator**. It builds a **single-page application** with fast client-side navigation, leveraging the full power of **React** to make your site interactive. It provides out-of-the-box **documentation features** but can be used to create **any kind of site** (personal website, product, blog, marketing landing pages, etc).

## 2.2 Installation

Before creating a new docusaurus website, you'll have to install Node.js version 14.13 or above. To do so, follow its official documentation.

After installing Node.js, you can validate its version through `node -v`

Now, you can navigate to the local folder where you have cloned your GitHub Repository. In my case this folder is named `github-actions-demo`.

Then, bootstrap a docusaurus website: `npx create-docusaurus@latest project-documentation classic`. Here, the `project-documentation` is the name of the website.

After executing that command, you should be faced with a new directory `project-documentation`.

It's structure should be something like this one:

``` 
project-documentation  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ blog  
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2019-05-28-hola.md  
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2019-05-29-hello-world.md  
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 2020-05-30-welcome.md  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs  
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ doc1.md  
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ doc2.md  
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ doc3.md  
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ mdx.md  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src  
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ css  
‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ custom.css  
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pages  
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.module.css  
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ static  
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ img  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docusaurus.config.js  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sidebars.js  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ yarn.lock
```

## 2.3 Run Docusaurus

To run our website, execute the following command from within the `project-documentation` folder : `npm run start`

You should be presented with a message similar to this one: 
`[SUCCESS] Docusaurus website is running at http://localhost:3000/.`


# 3. Install a GitHub Self-Hosted Runner, which will (test and) build your website.

Since we only want our website to run inside our infra-strucure (our documentation will be considered confidential), we will deploy a GitHub Self-Hosted Runner, in order to build and deploy the website inside a VM that is not exposed to the world.

To do so, follow this tutorial: [Adding self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/pt/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners) 

Stop before executing the run.sh script. We will execute this script inside a `screen`so we can check its logs all the time.

Let's do it then:

``` bash
screen -S github-runner # create the screen
# then, we will be presented with a new session
# inside this section run
./run.sh
# After running this command, you should see the following message "Connected to GitHub"
# No exit the screen
# To do so, press ctrl + a + d
# If you want to re-attach the screen, execute 
# screen -r github-runner
# When doing this you should see the session that was created by the first command.
``` 

# 4. Create a GitHub Workflow

At the root of your repository execute the following commands:
``` bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
cd .github/workflows
touch deployment-workflow.yml
```

Now, add the following content to your `deployment-workflow.yml` file:

``` yaml
```yaml
name: GitHub Actions Demo
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
jobs:
  Explore-GitHub-Actions:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
      - run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
      - run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
      - run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is ${{ github.ref }} and your repository is ${{ github.repository }}."
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: echo "üí° The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
      - run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
      - name: List files in the repository
        run: |
          ls ${{ github.workspace }}
      - run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
```

Commit this file to your repository and check if the workflow is being executed.

In your GitHub Repository you should see that the action is being processed.

You can also see what is being executed in the workflow.

Also, if you check the screen where your runner is running you should see the following:

Now, we have to define what we want to do with our workflow!
In this demo, we have a NGINX Server deployed on the same VM as the GitHub Self-Hosted Runner. We will use this web serve our static site. So, the NGINX will retrieve the static file from a specific location and serve them to the end-users.

To get this static files (static website), you'll have to build your docusaurus project.

Inside your docusaurus project, run the following command: `npm run build`. After a few seconds the build process will end, and you'll be presented with a `build` folder. There you will find the rendered static files which NGINX will serve.

Now, let's check if everything is ok with our build. To do so, we will run a python simple HTTP server.

```
cd build
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

This will start a development web server in port 8080. Open your browser and check if the files are ok.

We can see the website is running!

![My Website](https://i.imgur.com/9NAtSKm.png)

Now we have to recall that NGINX will have to serve these pages, so we will have to provide this files in a location where NGINX can find them. We will have to create a new directory in our VM - `/var/www/docusaurus-website`  ( `mkdir -p /var/www/docusaurus-website`).

Then, we will have to configure our Self Hosted Agent to:

1 - Build the docusaurus website
2 - Just in case, make a backup of the older version of the website that was deployed.
3 - Move the files to the folder we have just created

We will store the backup files in the following directory `/var/www/docusaurus-website-backups` (you'll need to create it).


For now, let's start with something simple. Update your `deployment-workflow.yml` file, so it matches this file:

```yaml
name: GitHub Actions Deployment Workflow
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
jobs:
  build_website:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
      - run: | # get inside the project and deal with the dependencies
          cd ${{ github.workspace }}/project-documentation 
          if [ -e yarn.lock ]; then
            yarn install --frozen-lockfile
          elif [ -e package-lock.json ]; then
            npm ci
          else
            npm i
          fi
      - run: |
          cd ${{ github.workspace }}/project-documentation 
          npm run build
```

Be sure if have Node.Js installed on your Runner's VM (same version) !

Now, check the GitHub Actions Tab to verify if the build was successful:

![Second Build](https://i.imgur.com/QtbHvHD.png)

Great, the project was rendered successful!

We can now update our GitHub Workflow to the following:

```yaml
name: GitHub Actions Deployment Workflow
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
jobs:
  build_website:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
      - run: | # get inside the project and deal with the dependencies
          cd ${{ github.workspace }}/project-documentation 
          if [ -e yarn.lock ]; then
            yarn install --frozen-lockfile
          elif [ -e package-lock.json ]; then
            npm ci
          else
            npm i
          fi
      - run: |
          cd ${{ github.workspace }}/project-documentation 
          npm run build

  crete_backup:
    needs: build_website
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
      - run: | # create a zip file with all the files and store it in the backups folder
          tar -czvf /var/www/docusaurus-website-backups/backup-$(date '+%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S').tar.gz /var/www/docusaurus-website
      - run: | # remove all backups older than 7 days
          find /var/www/docusaurus-website-backups/ -maxdepth 1 -type f -mtime +7 -print | xargs /bin/rm -f

  deploy_website:
    needs: crete_backup
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
      - run: | # delete old website files
          rm -rf /var/www/docusaurus-website/*
      - run: | # add the new ones
          cp -r ${{ github.workspace }}/project-documentation/build/* /var/www/docusaurus-website/
```

Notice the `needs: <job>` tag. These tags are used to define a sequence for executing each job. If you don't do this, several jobs can be executed in parallel.

After committing this new workflow, if we go to [atnog-cicd-classes2.av.it.pt/](https://atnog-cicd-classes2.av.it.pt/) we should be able to see our docusaurus website.

Now, lets add a few more READMEs!

Inside your docusaurus project execute the following command: `mkdir -p docs/my-tutorials`
Then, inside this folder, create the following files:

--- 

`_category_.json`
``` javascript 
{
  "label": "My New Tutorials",
  "position": 4,
  "link": {
    "type": "generated-index"
  }
}
```

---

`README1.md`
``` markdown 
---
sidebar_position: 1
---

# README 1

This is my first README!!!
```

---

`README2.md`
``` markdown 
---
sidebar_position: 2
---

# README 2

This is my first README!!!
```

---

Now, commit these new files to your GitHub repository. Wait for the workflow to run and open the website. There you should see these new files.
